EngHealthCLIP: Enhancing Multicultural Health Interventions with English Education

Overview

EngHealthCLIP is an innovative framework that leverages the multi-modal CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model to integrate electroencephalogram (EEG) data with English text and image data. The project aims to improve the acceptance and effectiveness of multicultural health interventions through the transformative power of English education. By expanding health monitoring capabilities to diverse linguistic communities, EngHealthCLIP enhances the interpretability and utility of EEG data across different cultural contexts.

Features

Multimodal Integration: Combines EEG data with language and visual information for a comprehensive analysis.

Enhanced Health Monitoring: Expands the scope of health monitoring to different linguistic communities.

Accurate Health Detection: Detects stress, fatigue, and other health indicators more accurately than traditional EEG-based models.

Scalable Public Health Solutions: Applicable to diverse global health initiatives.

Getting Started

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and the necessary libraries installed, including PyTorch, Transformers, and NumPy.

Installation:

git clone https://github.com/username/EngHealthCLIP.git
cd EngHealthCLIP
pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Model: Use the provided scripts to run experiments and integrate EEG with CLIP-based analysis.

python run_experiment.py --data_path ./data/sample_eeg_data --model_path ./models/pretrained_model

Experimental Results

Our experimental results show that EngHealthCLIP outperforms traditional EEG-based health monitoring models in detecting health indicators such as stress and fatigue. This proves its potential for global public health applications.
