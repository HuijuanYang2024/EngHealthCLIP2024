# **EngHealthCLIP: A Multimodal Framework for Multicultural Health Interventions**

## **Overview**
EngHealthCLIP is an advanced multimodal framework that leverages EEG data, English text, and image modalities to enhance the acceptance and effectiveness of multicultural health interventions. By integrating the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model with EEG signal analysis and attention-based data fusion, the framework is capable of detecting stress levels, fatigue scores, and other health indicators across diverse linguistic communities.

This repository provides the full implementation of EngHealthCLIP, including training, evaluation, and multimodal data processing. It is designed for researchers and developers working in public health, AI, and multilingual applications.

## **Features**
1. **Multimodal Integration**:
   - Combines EEG, text, and image data using CLIP.
   - Attention-based feature fusion for robust performance.

2. **Multi-task Learning**:
   - Supports classification (e.g., stress detection) and regression (e.g., fatigue score prediction) tasks.

3. **Customizable**:
   - Easily modify model architecture, loss functions, and fusion strategies.

4. **Scalable**:
   - Designed for diverse cultural contexts with language-independent EEG and image analysis.

5. **Interpretable**:
   - Attention mechanism provides insights into modality contributions.
